# Read the document of the string methods at
# https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

# You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. 
# strip and replace are particular useful

# The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. 
# For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. 
# So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.
